# DesignPatterns

This is a console application demonstrating C# interpretations of multiple software design patterns.
It consolidates the results of some previous projects, which are now deleted.

The project was based on numerous texts and online courses, including, of course, the famous book by "The Gang of Four".
I've made every effort to come up with original scenarios illustrating each of the patterns.

The application is built using .NET 9 and C# 13, but is compatible with at least .NET 8.

At the top level, you will find the menu structure, created to facilitate the demonstration of each of the pattern examples.
The actual examples are located in separate folders inside subfolders of the PatternExamples folder, corresponding to the different types of design patterns.
In each such folder, there is a brief description of the pattern and the scenario, plus a Mermaid class diagram script.
Please note that to properly view the Mermaid diagram in Visual Studio, you might need to install the Markdown Editor v2 extension.
